MetaPurge is a privacy-focused Android app that removes hidden metadata (EXIF, GPS, device info) from your photos.

Every time you take a picture, your phone stamps hidden data into the file: GPS Coordinates, Device Model, Date/Time, and Settings. If you upload this photo to social media or forums, you are doxxing yourself.

MetaPurge scans your images for these threats and surgically removes them, leaving you with a clean, safe file that contains pixels and nothing else.

- Removes EXIF, TIFF, GPS, and IPTC metadata instantly
- Warns you if GPS/Device ID tags are found
- 100% Offline - works entirely on your device
